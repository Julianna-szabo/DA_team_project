# DA1 Team Assignment
This repository contains our work to complete the team assignment for the ECBS5140 - Data Analysis 1 course at CEU.

# Goal
Our goal is to collect and analyze data on pizzerias located in Budapest. Our focus is on margherita pizza and 0.5l beverage prices and we want to investigate whether these prices are different for on-site (dine-in) and delivery consumption.

# Data
Our dataset consists of 40 observations. From these 40 observations 20 are for on-site consumption and 20 are for delivery.

Data was collected manually by visiting either the catering unit's website or searching for them on third-party food delivery services sites such as netpincer.hu or wolt.com/hu.

While looking for margherita pizza prices we sticked to the classic, basic options offered by catering units in order to maximize our chances of comparing observations that are for the same product.

As far as 0.5l beverages are considered, we opted for any 0.5l soda drink that was available at a particular catering unit. If such standardized 0.5l products as the Pepsi or the Coca-Cola coke were available we used their prices rather than lesser known drinks.
